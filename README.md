# git rebase -i exercise

Philip, Terence and Brad are 3 fellow students and have been assigned to write a simple program together in collaboration.
Having recently learned about git they got into a frenzy and started using it right away, they unfortunately are lacking some experience.
They realize that their commits are somewhat nonsensical and are a pain to review. They are afraid that their teacher is going to underrate them for it.
They come forward to the only git wizard they know (you) to get them out of their seemingly unavoidable doom.
You're able to immediately identify each student's problem : 
- Philip is a very cautious student and is always suspecting his computer is going to burst into flames.
- Terence is special to say the least, he has his own way of coding and his commits are unintelligible but to him.
- Brad Works on many school projects and side project simultaneously, he sometimes gets confused and due to lack of sleep scrambles code around.

Each student worked on different branch, They wish for the reversePhilip branch to be merged first, the clipWhiteSpaceTerence branch to be merged second and finally the printRightAndWrongWayBrad branch to be merged last. They also wish to retain a maximum of history for their teacher to know they didn't cheat.

Your goal is to help them have a comprehensive working tree using the magic of the interactive rebase feature of git.
If your memory is failing you, you may get inspiration from a little cheatsheet hidden in the .cheatsheet directory ;)

TLDR; fix the nonsensical commits to have a clean main tree at the end
